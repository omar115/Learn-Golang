* GO has two basic data structures
- 1. arrays
- 2. slices
- array is fixed length list of things
- slice is an array that can grow or shrink
- array length is fixed
- slice length is not fixed
- slice must be same data type ***
- array can be different data type ***

* it is similar concept of list and tuple in python
- list size can be extended similar to slice
- tuple lenght is fixed similar to array in golang

* slices are zero index
    - means the first index value is 0

* array is similar to tuple in python
- array size is fixed and can not be changed
