# a map is a collection of key value pairs
- it is similar to Python dictionary
- both key and values are statically typed

# how to create an empty map
colors := make(map[string]string)
- it will create an empty map
- the value will be zero

# difference between struct and map
- map: all keys and values will be same type
- struct: all values can be different type
- in map, all keys are indexed
- in struct all keys are not indexed
- map is reference type
- struct is value type
